            As South-East Asian countries cautiously plan and start reopening schools following COVID-19 lockdowns, 
            the ‘new normal’ of education requires that public health protocols are respected and educational policies 
            continuously revised to ensure that no student misses out on education.
            <br>
            The South-East Asian region has recorded 104,000 COVID-19 cases and at least 3,000 deaths from the virus, 
            though the pattern of disease-spread and containment strategies have differed widely. 
            <br>
            Singapore leads in cases with 38,300 but only 25 deaths while Indonesia, with 32,000 cases, leads in deaths, 
            with nearly 1,900.The Philippines has seen over 22,000 COVID-19 cases and 1,000 deaths.

            Perez’s interests took her to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), where she discovered 
            the power of satellite data. She then joined the IESM where, over the last six years, her research projects 
            included the practical use of satellite observations in developing computing tools to predict the impact of
             environmental changes.

                 My research makes use of satellite data which enables simultaneous measurement of different 
                 environmental variables. With satellite remote sensing we can examine spatial distribution of 
                 vegetation, temperature, precipitation and soil moisture that, in turn, provide the ability to assess
                  drought impacts.
