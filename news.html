            </header>
            <article>
                Daily additions of new cases are now at a seven-month low, with only 21 districts reporting 1,000 
            or more infections this week. Most of these districts are in Kerala and Maharashtra.</br>
            </br>
            For the first time 
            since June 2020, India has added fewer than 100,000 new coronavirus cases in a week, government data
            from the past seven days shows.
            <br>
            
                With the virus largely in control, the focus has moved to the vaccination drive, which began on 16 January.
                A total of 786,842 healthcare workers got their first dose in the first five days. Karnataka administered
                16% of these doses, Andhra Pradesh 15%, Telangana 11%, and Odisha and West Bengal 6% each.
